# landingPageChallenge
Open ended challenge to recreate an auto sales landing page. 

Requirements included:
1. Must be fully responsive
2. Buttons don't need to redirect anywhere
3. Search does not need to submit

A personal goal was to limit the use of plugins and supportive technologies in order to highlight the fundamental abilities of HTML and CSS. Next stages of development would likely focus on scaling the site.
